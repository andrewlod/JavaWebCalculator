# Java Web Calculator
This application demonstrates how database operations can be made with the Hibernate library, along with Web development with Spring MVC.

## Features
This is a calculator that maintains a history of all your operations based on the account you are logged in. Once the user is in the main page, it is possible to either make a new account or log into an existing account. Once logged in, the user may type a mathematical expression (i.e. (1+3)\*5), then they will be redirected to the result page, where the result is available, as well as the previous operations made by that user.

## Architecture
This project was developed in Eclipse IDE, created with Maven architecture with the following major dependencies (complete list in `pom.xml`):
- Hibernate
- MySQL
- Spring Boot + MVC
- Thymeleaf
- Exp4j (mathematical expression parsing)

## Preview
Here are a few screenshots of the application running. As its focus is to demonstrate the Java structure behind the Web pages, they may look raw. You may refer to https://github.com/andrewlod/react-spotify-clone for an application example with stylized Web pages created with React.
